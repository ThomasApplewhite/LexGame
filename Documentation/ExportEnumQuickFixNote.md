WOAH Just found out you CAN export enums! You can't just us them as type hints. I should go check around and fix that! Because enums are really useful and stuff!

Okay, I did it! Which wasn't super hard, as the amount of things that actually export enums is really small. Which is fine!

As a side note, you know how you can export enums but not custom resources? The custom resources thing is a semi-bug, and it really only made it into Godot 4. So it won't be a problem in the future, but you will just have to live with it for now. :(
