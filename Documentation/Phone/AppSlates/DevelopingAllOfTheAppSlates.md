Time to make all of the AppSlates!

# Text Message Slate
The Text Slate needs to do three things:
1. Have a list of all texted contacts that are selectable to pick a specific conversation.
2. Display a conversation history for each contact so that things can be kept up with.
3. Display PromptControls that are needed for resolving certain conversations.
4. Send notifications when texts aren't periodically responded to.

# Home Slate
The Home Slate just needs a button for every other slate. This one is just going second because it'll make testing all the other ones (and finishing phone stubbing) easier.

# What comes next?
The phone needs push notifications. After that, GameDaemon integration with the phone and speech bubble pop ups. From there, game sequence scripting. Then visuals and sound! And then jee whiz that's it! But that's a ***lot*** of work. So yeah.
