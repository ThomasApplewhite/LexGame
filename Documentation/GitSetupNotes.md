To get Git going, I need Git both on my laptop and my computer, AND some sort of VPN client to connect them. And then I also need to figure out how to link the two over VPN.

- Git is easy. It can be installed from terminal without much fuss.
- I need to decide on a VPN. It can be pretty simple, since right now I never need to do anything other than LAN
- Connecting the two git instances will take a little bit of thought, especially getting it worked out with the VPN. That will come last.
