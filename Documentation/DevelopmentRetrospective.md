- Do documentation as you write classes. Flowing out an entire class _feels_ nice, but if you need to do 3 or 4 or 5 classes at once, you'll fall behind real quickly
- Diagram out engineering needs before hand. Don't stub out things and get to it later. Not only does this create tech debt, it can create massive amounts of tech debt out of nowhere.
- If you anticipate a lot of classes having interdependency, try to eliminate them, or at least organize the interdependencies linearly. Obviously not creating them is easier.
- Try to keep important names short. Class names, public methods, and important concepts all need to be short to save on line space. File names can only be so long, and if names get too long you'll end up having super over-length lines that do nothing. That's a bit of a pain.
- Data driven assets! Use and use them well! Great way to abstract out information into containers that don't have to be nodes. Godot 4 even lets you export resource types! They're like Unity Scriptable Objects in that way.
- Learn how to spell 'Receive'. It's spelled "Recieve" in 90% of the game.
- Figure out a better documentation methodology. Having a markdown compatible doc scheme is a good idea, but setting up your docs to easily turn into a GitHub wiki would be better! Also something that is easier to do automatically. idk just make it a bit easier on yourself.
- Careful with signals! Just, like, in general. Changing them can be a pain!
- Make sure that your "server" repository is origin! Makes things easier that way!
- Devise a more efficient way to do file handling/documentation outside of Godot. The editor doesn't seem to be equipped for that out-of-the-box. Maybe there can be an extension for that? Or, at least, you can figure out something better than just mark-down files and the folder viewer. Maybe some scripts would help. You know bash, you could do it.
- Become more familiar with Godot's "Call Down, Signal Up" idea. It sounds nice for making sure coupling between nodes doesn't get really annoying!
- Don't put scenes and their respective scripts in the same folder. Mixing them together is lowkey really annoying.
