- Do documentation as you write classes. Flowing out an entire class _feels_ nice, but if you need to do 3 or 4 or 5 classes at once, you'll fall behind real quickly
- Diagram out engineering needs before hand. Don't stub out things and get to it later. Not only does this create tech debt, it can create massive amounts of tech debt out of nowhere.
- If you anticipate a lot of classes having interdependency, try to eliminate them, or at least organize the interdependencies linearly. Obviously not creating them is easier.
- Try to keep important names short. Class names, public methods, and important concepts all need to be short to save on line space. File names can only be so long, and if names get too long you'll end up having super over-length lines that do nothing. That's a bit of a pain.
- Data driven assets! Use and use them well! Great way to abstract out information into containers that don't have to be nodes. Godot 4 even lets you export resource types! They're like Unity Scriptable Objects in that way.
- Learn how to spell 'Receive'. It's spelled "Recieve" in 90% of the game.
- Figure out a better documentation methodology. Having a markdown compatible doc scheme is a good idea, but setting up your docs to easily turn into a GitHub wiki would be better! Also something that is easier to do automatically. idk just make it a bit easier on yourself.
- Careful with signals! Just, like, in general. Changing them can be a pain!
- Make sure that your "server" repository is origin! Makes things easier that way!
- Devise a more efficient way to do file handling/documentation outside of Godot. The editor doesn't seem to be equipped for that out-of-the-box. Maybe there can be an extension for that? Or, at least, you can figure out something better than just mark-down files and the folder viewer. Maybe some scripts would help. You know bash, you could do it.
- Become more familiar with Godot's "Call Down, Signal Up" idea. It sounds nice for making sure coupling between nodes doesn't get really annoying!
- Don't put scenes and their respective scripts in the same folder. Mixing them together is lowkey really annoying.
- Use a more intelligent editor for documentation. Markdown is cool because it's git compatible, but not being able to automate this process is really annoying.
- Figure out some way to do code-enforced mass signal connection with editor-connected signals. Maybe use groups? Is that a thing?
- Do not rely on UI for flat gameplay elements. If you need actual screen-space UI stuff, that's one thing. But Godot's UI system doesn't provide enough flexibility to support 100% of gameplay. It's there for visual ease, not gameplay ease.
	- Maybe. Idk it just frustrates me sometimes for reasons I don't fully understand.
- Figure out when exactly to use inheritance in Godot. Obviously Script inheritance is a thing, but node inheritance is not? I'm not sure. What's the best way to make a base scene/node/script/whatever to control the properties of a derived scene/node/script/whatever?
- What's the correct way to do button signals? Should each button have its own receiver method, or should buttons all link back to 1 method and the functionality be determined by which button was pressed? Obviously for arbitrarily many buttons the first is better, right? Right? Maybe I should invent a base class "Data Button" and the override of the Data Button is the data it sends, not the button's functionality itself?
- You need to keep a well defined Gameplay Outline or somehing. A document that details how the game and all its systems is supposed to work before you put everything in. Make ssure to check it VERY regularly to make sure you systems actually make sense and work properly.
- Move to a graphical version control. Your long file paths are annoying to do in terminals
- Figure out how to get your file paths to be shorter.
- When doing Gameplay-centric UI, the outermost control controls the actual size. Set that for pixel size, set interiors for scaling if they don't need custom internal positioning. Again, avoid using UI and Controls for gameplay.
