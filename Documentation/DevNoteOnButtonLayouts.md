I'm not going to work out automatic GUI-control-based prompt layouts. I'm just going to move on to the phone screens and do the rest of the gameplay functionality. Then, when I'm piecing together _actual_ game layout, I will manually create PromptControl layouts (or, at least, prefab layout appliers) to load the PromptControl to appear correctly when they get themed. They're only going to appear in text clouds or in the phone anyways, they don't _need_ to really adapt to resolution.
