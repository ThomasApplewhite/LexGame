I asked Lex the following questions to make sure I had the right idea on how the game should feel/progress. tl;dr: I do. The only caveat is that Lex wasn't really texting anyone else at the time and obv didn't have the bank account trouble. Those two details I think I'm gonna take artistic liberties with.

Anyways, the questions and answers:

About what happened that night? After I had texted you, when did you make the flight reservation? Or did you do it before?
So my friend and I were at this burlesque show at a bar near where we live. I didn't have to work the next day so I was hanging out, drinking. The second I got the text from you I texted dad to confirm, then I went about trying to buy my plane ticket.

What kind of music was playing in the bar?
By that time the show was over so it was just like, normal? idk I honestly don't remember. pop music/electronic stuff.

Were you trying to do anything while arranging the tickets?
So it was me and my two friends, but they didn't know each other so the two of them were talking. Meanwhile I was not paying attention at all which felt rude but they seemed to be getting along? My friend and I also knew one of the performers because we're big fans of theirs, so they came over to say hi but of course I wasn't super present and so it felt like everything was happening at once but I had this much more important thing to do at that exact moment that would radically change the way the next three days would go, especially since it was already late and I would need to fly out at like 5 am.

What was it like trying to navigate a flight schedule while drunk?
Reading is so hard lmao like wow. I can't see.

What is it like to be drunk? Remember, I've never been drunk before.
You get woozy and loose and liquid and it gets hard to read and focus. Motor skills also go out the door so I had to focus to make sure I was doing the right things and inputting stuff like my debit card information correctly. I'm pretty good at texting while drunk though, it just takes a lot of energy

What kind of phone did you have?
Galaxy s20 I think? I had to replace it in the fall of last year so I don't quit remember but it was a samsung and I was using the Southwest app which is what I normally use to book flights.

What are your pronouns? I think I know but I want to be sure.
They
Anything you want to add or ask about?
You were the one that informed me we could go visit lmao, I didn't hear from anyone else. Obviously dad had a lot going on but it felt like no one ever tells me anything lmao. Also my flight was kinda miserable since I was exhausted and hungover but I made it fine and it was relatively painless.

Let me know if there's anything else you need or if you wanna talk through it more!!
