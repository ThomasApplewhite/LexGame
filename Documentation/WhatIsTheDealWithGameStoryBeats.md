What do Game Story Beats actually do?

I'm not totally sure. How are the supposed to interact? What do they track? I never really planned out what they would do.

There's also a problem with GSBs: They can't be sent while the ConversationAppSlate is inactive because it gets deleted. This needs to be resolved. A potentially easy (but annoying) fix would be to move the parser from the ConvoAppSlate to the ConvoEntry.

But also, are GSBs even needed for first playable? If I'm going for straight finished, do I even need them? Well, yes, for the Plane ticket bit. 

Here's what I'll do. For now: only Lex will send GSBs. Since Lex is the only one doing things ever, only Lex needs to send GSBs! That also means that we don't have to worry about GSBs being sent passively by normal text. Yes.
